This Power BI project explores global space mission data to identify patterns in launch activity, organizational performance, mission outcomes, and cost efficiency. The goal was to derive insights that reflect how different countries and organizations are evolving in the space sector, and what factors contribute to mission success or failure.

#### Project Overview
I worked through the complete Power BI workflow â€” from cleaning and transforming raw data, to building DAX measures and designing visuals that answer a set of real-world analytical questions. The dataset includes details on mission dates, organizations, locations, rocket types, costs, and success statuses.

#### What I Did
Cleaned and prepared the dataset using Power Query by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and creating new fields such as year, month, quarter, weekday, and hour from the mission date.

Developed DAX measures to calculate success rates, average costs per launch, launch frequencies, and other KPIs.

Created visuals to answer 12 targeted business questions about trends, performance, and cost-risk relationships in space missions.

Used bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, maps, and treemaps to present insights in a clear and interactive format.

Focused on building a clean and logical data model that supports accurate and flexible analysis across different filters.

#### Key Questions Answered
Which years or periods show significant changes in launch volume?

What seasonal or quarterly trends exist in launch frequency?

Which organizations lead in number of launches and cost-efficiency?

How does cost relate to mission success or failure?

Which countries and rocket types are emerging or most reliable?
